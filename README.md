Learn about my thinking style and sweet computer setup.

Firstly, why am I writing this? Well, to mainly share my thinking style. I've looked at the githubs and linkedins of others, but they don't tell much about themselves. People need to write a article to let people to actually know you. Projects on github do show passion, but there's a lot more to them that isn't known from just their work. So people reading this can know about me what they would need an extended period of knowing me otherwise. It's like a charcter self analysis. 

One thing I've realized is most students aren't writers, they're not keen to share their thoughts. I saw this on a class discussion board when I asked about what lessons people learnt in a 3 month long group project software course. We made an actual piece of usable goods trading software like kijiji. And this project was open ended so I learnt a lot like how to work and code in a group. I gave all my lessons over 7 paragraphs. There was 200 people in that class. The post showed 138 views. Only one preson replied, and they gave a good long answer like me. They had some same lessons, and some different interesting ones. 3 months for that 6-8 people group project is substantial. But just 1 other person was interested enough to share their experience about it. I was bummed. But it's a phenomenom, according to [this study](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/10-of-twitter-users-generate-over-90-of-content-study-finds-1.791107), "More than 90 per cent of the content on Twitter is generated by just 10 per cent of the people". I don't mean to make myself look special by this, just the phenomenom in a sense was shown in this case. Albeit some diffences to Twitter, but everyone should have replied, it was relateable to every single student. There's so little details about them. Beyond their github, there is much to know about their personality.

I find meaning in learning. If I were to retire tomorrow, I would spend a good chunk of my free time reading every book on my to read list. I've always been a curious person and if you those around me, you'll know that I ask a lot of questions. Questins makes life interesting. It's the master key to learning about others. I attended a virtual career fair held by my university lately and just by asking some good questions I was able to learn a good deal and it was entertaining. For example, for this cybersecurity position, at the expo booth, there was a person there. He was actually a intern for the same position 4 years back and is full time now. I asked, "What makes one a strong candidate for this position and what do you think you did that helped you be one?". I got a very good answer that I can implement. 

I have a lot of interests as well like watching history from my youtube subs, as well as a variety of educational content from global politics (Caspian Report) to urban planning (City Beautiful). I like reading my daily email newsletter from Axios, giving me just the 10 most important news items of the past day. I enjoy biking, reading, and writing (of course).

I'm a big fan of notion, I use it for my to do list, for my notes, my internship resources, job application tracker, basically everything to organize my life. Though I have a lot of to dos like "read this article" and boy has it overfilled for the past few months. Too much to read, not enough time.

I tinker a lot with my computer setup, physical and software. I use windows 10 but after graduation will switch to mac OS due to the cleaner design and functionality. For example, spotlight search should standard on windows. Instead it has the start menu which looks bloated and the search bar is small, it's in the bottom left of the screen. The windows 10 one is also a downgrade from windows 7, because it searches the internet sometimes, when there's chrome for that. Redundant feature which sometimes is annoying when you're searching for a file and it searches google. Also look at the way the time is displayed in the taskbar. It says AM/PM, which is redundant, of course someone knows if its AM or PM. Basic time sense. And it shows the year, 2021. Of course someone knows what year it is, come on. Knowing how to cut down something to it's essentials is a big part of my thinking. I'm __frugal__ and a __minimalist__. I think about what's needed and cut out the bloat, maximizing efficiency. It's a valuable belief, especially in this age of consumerism, as well as in software. General rule to simplify your code/architecure as simple much as possible. Or made in a way where it's simple to add features. Some up front complexity for long term simplicity in that case. 

For the start menu and taskbar time display, I've improved both. I use a program called powertoys run that launches programs and files, much quicker than the start menu. Here is a picture of both of them. Excuse the small launcher box, it's a bug that happened with the most recent windows update, still usable though:

And here is my windows desktop:

And here is my custom split keyboard, my most used tool. Like for most of the day my 2 hands rest on this thing:

Here is my keyboard layout, composed of 2 layers. The MOD1 key to the right of my right pinky switches to the second layer when held, like shift:

Notice how also I don't use QWERTY. Also notice how the symbols and are are optimized for programming. Navigating with just my left thumb is a godsend.

2 months ago in July 2021 I built that keyboard to maximize comfort with less hand movement. I can program and do everything without moving my hands away. For programming, your right hand moves a lot with the arrows keys. With this, all arrow keys are on my left hand. When I type or progam my hands literally stay in place the whole time, it's so nice. I switched to a keyboard layout called Colemak DH. According to calculations, total finger movement is half of that of QWERTY. It maximizes home row key usage and lateral movement for the fingers. And that is perfect since my keyboard has parallel vertical keys. The horizontal curve matches the natural curve of the 5 fingers. I topped out at 120 WPM for QWERTY when I took a typing test recently. But it's not realistically my real world wpm. At first switching was painful. Every since I was a wee child I was typing. My brain's muscle memory from 15 years of my life typing QWERTY had to be rewired. On monkeytype.com I did a typing test and started at 10 wpm. But I kept on going and after a month I'm at 60 wpm, a good speed. Realistically I think I am the same as qwerty when typing normally. I can feel that I'm using the home row more and reducing finger movement. Most of all, it is nice being able to type with my hands spread apart. Try it yourself, spread out your arms straight and ghost type. Then bring them closer like a normal keyboard. I think this is enough to convice anyone of how much more comfortable a split keyboard is.

It's odd to me that programmers use their keyboard for their jobs, for their whole lives, but haven't changed a thing about their keyboards. Even remapping the caps lock key to the backspace button reduces pinky movement significantly.   

I also have a 27" 4k display on a table mount, and the center is at eye level so I'm somewhat forced to sit with my back straight. My desk is mostly empty. I try to have as few things in my room as possible so it's as clean as my desktop wallpaper. 

What do these things tell about me? I would say __innovation__. I'm an independent minded person, I don't follow the status quo blindly, I like debate so I'm able to compare things critically. And I'm a big believer in __improvement__ and __optimization__, I try to see things for what they could be, not just what they are. I think idea sharing goes a long way in this as well. So I subscribe to a few tech email newsletters just to know what's the latest things in tech. 

And how does this relate to software? One of software's purposes is to make things easier. Many open source programs were made to improve upon something, like the powertoys run program above. 

I would go into my thoughts on software but that wouldn't be as comprehensive as my __philosophy__. I think a good developer is more than just a coding machine, but a __thinker__. There's a lot of room for creativity software development is an art. I think the values I have guide me to not just be a good __coding machine__, but a good __software developer__. I have a lot to learn regarding the art but it's been really interesting seeing how important philosophies are when programming. This was one thing I mentioned in my post in that group project software course. I'll end on this interesting quote I have saved:

What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, 
led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey.
When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to 
winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. 
I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that 
you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room

So now you know a lot about me. Like, a lot. This was a massive dump of my personality, interests, and my tools, so I hope you enjoyed and maybe check out my stuff and adopt them as well.
