# about-me-in-10-mins
Learn about my thinking style and sweet computer setup.

Firstly, why am I writing this? Well, to mainly share my thinking style and computer hardware/software setup so others can learn more about me if they're interested. This is for friends and anyone on Linkedin who wants to know more about me. Also saves me time, I can write this once and share this unlimited times instead of having to repeat it every time I talk to someone using the power of writing.

I've realized in the behavioral interview rounds for internship, they may ask a very open question, "tell me about yourself". When they ask a student this, you can't expect a in depth answer unless they have a script ready to read from. This script took me 5-8 hours to write over 3 sessions and I changed it a lot in every iteration. It's been polished and well thought over, it's not easy answering this in a substantial manner. And you might as well read that script then instead of hearing me say it because it saves you time, you don't have to schedule that behavioral interview for every student, and reading is on average faster than speaking (google says 230 wpm vs. 150). Also less awkward because the student, like me here, would go on a 10 minute monologue. Monologues are nice to read but kinda awkward to listen to in a 2 way conversation like a interview. So here's my script which you can read instead at your convenience. And to add yet another reason, the answer to this question is basically the whole behavioral round, 10 minutes per student. No need ot schdule a 30 monute interview. Saves 50 minutes total per student/manager pair. 50 out of 60 minutes between the two is saved per round. For the student, imagine they get 10 behaviorial interviews. They'll spend hours of their life, precious also when school is in full swing, for just a chance. But instead of repeating the same script, they can use the power of writing and the internet to answer this question once and share with 0 time cost. Like the codesignal online assesment, answer once, share anywhere. Super time efficient. And you get more thoughtful answers in writing as you can iterate the script.

Personal experience actually, I got asked the "tell me about yourself" question in a (initial round) "chat" with the founder of a small startup. And I got caught flat footed, didn't know where to start, first time someone asked me that question in many years. I gave some info in 2ish minutes but in all honestly it was a poor answer, too all over the place, too garbled, much worse than this. I got rejected a few days later and I realized the chat was basically a behaviorial analysis of me. I didn't really know what he meant by that question though. Maybe he expected some dazzling personal project or some sort, he did ask what I made also. Though on second thought maybe he expected me to ask him to clarify what he wanted to know about me. I don't know, but this was the first time I got some sort of video chat/interview with someone at the company I applied to. And boy did I blow it. So this experience coupled with me being the kind of person who likes to read/write about my philosophy, pc setup, and productivity tools, got me to write this article. 

Do I think this script that answers the question "tell me about yourself" is important? Absolutey. Describing you interests and who you are says a boatload about you. A student is usually 18-22 years old. If they learn to speak at the 1 year mark according to google, and that's when they start to understand what others say, that means they've been speaking/listening for 6205 to 7665 days. Lotta days. They've been exposed to many perspectives (hopefully), especially in the age of the internet where physical distance is neglible, what worldviews have one solidified by then? What are their interests, beliefs? If one can't explain their views, they haven't explored and thought about the world. Probably indulging n too much entertainment than thinking about the world, it's problems, how it works. I've seen people like this, don't read the news, don't know what's going on. It's like they live life on autopilot. So this question does give you a good view inside their brains, or more accurately, what is has accumulated in 6205 to 7665 days. Most of the classes I've took in my life since middle school were useless if I think about the lessons I learnt them. I think the north american education system up till the end of high school is too easy and broken, but that's another topic. Just thinking silently for many hours and reading whatever on the internet taught me to think more critically than what all of my english classes have done. There's people who are 50, 60 years old and they're not getting vaccinated. Such a long life and they still haven't understood the societal concept of specialization and to trust experts. This quote explains it well, "Some people have 10 years of experience. Others have 1 year of experience 10 times." You have to think properly if you want to make use of your experiences. Older does not mean wiser. At one point in middle school I just started thinking every night about what happened in my life and that unlocked a new part of my brain. The very basic litmus test of getting vaccinated was a crazy statistic of how many people haven't figured out basic concepts like specialization making society as advanced as it is today. So in conclusion, this "tell me about yourself" question, when answered in a prepared and lenghty manner as I'm doing right now, shows how one's mind and views have culminated over 6205 to 7665 days, for a student specifically in this range, of living in a complex and interesting world. And it a time where knowledge is so free and accessible. So how is one not interesing in such a complex, interesting world and not form any viewpoints? Open ended question but this boggles me when I encounter someone like this?

There's a quote I read about software, the difference between a junior and senior dev is that a senior dev has made up opinions on how to do certain things. They also need the critical thinking to be able to benefit from their experiences. Simply experience is not enough, thinking ability, perceptioin, is just as important.

Random point but it's kind of crazy to think how software has evolved in just the last 20 years, and I was alive in the 2000s. What I can make now as a mere student is crazy. Just 10 years ago deploying a web app would be difficult, I read an article of someone talking about how it was like 10 years ago trying to deploy softwart. Now you can do one in a few lines of code + clicks with Heroku.
 
I believe people who read about all sorts of topics are interesting because they able to see things from a variety of perspectives, critically, and you can have a discussion with them. I haven't come across many people like this in a situation where you can chat about anything but when I do it's evident early on, they ask interesting questions and say interesting comments. Like for a linux + systems programming course, I went to office hours once over zoom, which are neglected by students and they're a great place to get to know and chat with your professor/teaching assistant (a upper year student). It this case was the professor and 2 teaching assistants in the zoom meeting, quietly waiting for any students. I have a feeling that in most office hours (which has been true so far to what I've seen), the prof/TA get no students attending, unless it's right before an assignment or test, and if students do come, then they mainly, talk about the course content. Only like 5% of the times I have been to office hours I saw students talking about something other the course content such as a random interesting topic. So as I was saying, in that instance I went to office hours and brought up some topics about the software field and expressed my opinion about them. One of them was that the title software engineer is pretentious and meaningless, since there are no standards like with mechanical/civil engineers to get certified, and the proper term is software developer instead and we had a interesting talk about that and other things.  

So basically, interesting people are interesting to talk to. And this transfers directly to the software world. There's a email newsletter called console (on substack ) I'm subscribed to of a guy who asks these kind of questions (through text interviews) to creators of open source projects. The answers are insightful, like he asks for their most controversial opinion and why. The author is one of those people I'd be interested in talking to. He has that kind of thinking in regards to asking questions if it was applied to vast world of software. With software, the impactful ones you see, especially open source ones like say the productivity tools I talk about later on which I use to get around my computer faster, you need good ideas to make them. It's all about the idea. Once you understand the world, think about it's problems, you are able to change it. You'll read this a lot in start up/incubator sessions if you go to one. You gotta be a thinker to be a good developer, see things from different perspectives. It's not knowing just __how__ to code/create but also knowing __what__ to code/create. Steve jobs is a good examble, he couldn't code, was surprising to me when I read it, but his ability to see the big picture and also his minimalist philosophy could directly be applied to Apple's hardware and software and that's why Apple was and is a leader in innovation, like with the recent M1 chip. And this applies to any field where you make/handle complex things. The ability to see from different perspectives is a skill I've seen many to miss. I used to watch a lot of debates, and did my fair share on the internet haha, so I've managed to hone this skill well, not to brag, but debating helps you learn to think critically.

One thing I've realized is most students aren't writers, they're not keen to share their thoughts. I saw this on a class discussion board on this nice platform called discourse.org, when I asked about what lessons people learnt in a 3 month group project software course. Every group had 6-8 members, these were big groups, the software specs given were also lenghty. Every group had to make an actual piece of usable software, a goods trading software like kijiji, and we were to add some custom features that we decided. The implementation of the specs were open ended so I learnt a lot like how to brainstorm, plan, and work and code in a group. I was in other group it other courses but it was interesting how it played out in a lenghthy software project. Using a plugin my group's project was 20,000 lines of code long, excluding empty lines and comments. I plan on deploying it to the web actually some time. So made that post and wrote all my lessons over 7 paragraphs. There was 200 people taking that class. The post had 138 views. But only one person replied. And they replied well. They had some of same lessons I had, like plan meetings properly and be prepared, and some other interesting ones. 138 people took the same course, spent 50-150 hours on it, and only one had anything at all to say? Mind boggling. I was bummed. But it's a phenomenom, according to [this study](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/10-of-twitter-users-generate-over-90-of-content-study-finds-1.791107), "More than 90 per cent of the content on Twitter is generated by just 10 per cent of the people". Albeit some diffences to Twitter, but everyone should have replied, at leaste tens of replies, it was relateable to every single student. As I said about not knowing how somone is like from just their github and linkedin, there's so little details about them. There is much to know about their personality.

Moving on, I find meaning in learning. If I were to retire tomorrow, I would spend a good chunk of my free time reading the books on my to read list. I've always been a curious person and if you those around me, you'll know that I ask a lot of questions. Questins makes life interesting. It's the master key to learning about others. I attended a virtual career fair held by my university lately and just by asking some good questions I was able to learn a good deal and it was entertaining. For example, for this cybersecurity position, at the expo booth, there was a person there. He was actually a intern for the same position 4 years back and is full time now. I asked, "What makes one a strong candidate for this position and what do you think you did that helped you be one?". I got a very good answer that I can implement. I like asking questions.

I have a lot of interests as well like watching history from my youtube subs, as well as a variety of educational content from global geopolitics (Caspian Report) to urban planning (City Beautiful). My youtube subs probably say a lot about me. I like reading my daily email newsletter from Axios, giving me just the 10 most important news items of the past day. I enjoy biking, reading, and writing (of course).

I'm a big fan of notion, I use it for my to do list, for my class notes, my internship resources and application tracker, basically everything to organize my life. Though I have a lot of to dos like "read this article" and boy has it has overfilled for the past few months. Too much to read, not enough time. I have a google extension called close tab which helps with this. It's a neat open source project. 

I tinker a lot with my computer setup, both physical and software. I use windows 10 but after graduation will switch to mac OS due to the cleaner design and functionality. For example, spotlight search from mac OS should be standard on windows. Instead it has the start menu which has way too many items on it and the search bar is small, and it's in the bottom left of the screen instead of the center. The windows 10 one is also a downgrade from windows 7, because it searches the internet sometimes, when there's chrome for that. Redundant feature which sometimes is annoying when you're searching for a file and it searches google. Also look at the way the time is displayed in the taskbar. It says AM/PM, which is redundant, of course someone knows if its AM or PM. Basic time sense. And it shows the year, 2021. Of course someone knows what year it is, come on. Knowing how to cut down something to it's essentials is a big part of my thinking. I'm __frugal__ and a __minimalist__. I think about what's needed and cut out the bloat, maximizing efficiency. It's a valuable belief, especially in this age of consumerism, as well as in software. Like with software, I read from this helpful dev, maintain high quality, even at the cost of features. Never sacrifice quality.

For the start menu and taskbar time display, I've improved both with how they look. I replaced the start menu with a program called powertoys runand it is much quicker. Here is a picture of both of them. Excuse the small launcher box, it's a bug that happened with the most recent windows update, still usable though:

And here is my windows desktop:

And here is my custom split keyboard, my most used tool. For most of the day my 2 hands rest on this thing:

![iris keyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/134283851-9a972128-a0be-46ce-b811-38752611d7e5.jpg)

Here is my keyboard layout, composed of 2 layers. The MOD1 key to the right of my right pinky switches to the second layer when held, like shift:

![iris layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/134281550-5646a149-4423-410c-ae1a-52b61e58b5e0.png)

Notice how also I don't use QWERTY. Also notice how the symbols and are are optimized for programming. Navigating the arrow keys with just my left thumb is a godsend. There's so much to opimize which most people don't care about. Such simple changes that can you do that has a large effect on how something looks or works.

In July 2021 I built my split keyboard to maximize comfort with less hand movement. I can program and do everything without moving my hands away. For programming, your right hand moves a lot with the arrows keys. With this, all arrow keys are on my left hand. When I type or progam my hands stay in place the whole time, it's so nice. I also switched to a keyboard layout called Colemak DH. According to calculations, total finger movement is half of that of QWERTY. It maximizes home row key usage and lateral movement for the fingers. Notice the columns are parallel. The horizontal curve matches the natural curve of the fingers. You can read stories of programmers getting hand or wrist pain so I took steps to make writing, coding, everything as nice as possible. I topped out at 120 WPM for QWERTY when I took a typing test before. But it's not realistically my real world typing wpm, your brain doesn't type that fast. At first switching layouts was painful. Every since I was a wee child I was typing. My brain's muscle memory of 15 years typing QWERTY had to be rewired. It's interesting how I was able to without that much difficulty, does it vary by person I wonder. On monkeytype.com I did a typing test and started at 10 wpm. But I kept on going and after a month I'm at 60 wpm, a good speed. Realistically I think I am the same as qwerty when typing normally. I confirmed that I'm using the home row more and reducing finger movement with a key logger actually. And most of all, it is nice being able to type with my hands spread apart. Try it yourself, spread out your arms straight out forward and ghost type. Then bring them closer like a normal keyboard. I think this is enough to convice anyone of how much more comfortable a split keyboard is.

It's odd to me that programmers use their keyboard for their jobs, for their whole lives, but according to my small sample space most haven't changed a thing about their keyboards. Even remapping the caps lock key to the backspace button reduces pinky movement significantly. Their most used tool is unoptimized.

I have a 27" 4k display on a table mount, and the center is at eye level so I'm forced to sit with my back straight. Online you'll read advice saying the top should be at eye level but that allows you to bend your head down, it's illogical. My desk is mostly empty. I try to have as few things in my room as possible so it's as clean as my desktop wallpaper. 

What do these things tell about me? I would say I'm a big fan of __innovation__ and __optimization__. And how does this relate to software? One of software's purposes is to make things easier. Many open source programs were made to improve upon something, like the powertoys run program above. 

I'm an independent minded person, I don't follow the status quo blindly, I like debate so I'm able to compare things critically. I try to see things for what they really are, not just what they look on the superficial level. So you'll hear me bash the consumerist culture we live in in the west, hah, it's destroying the Earth, but I could write a whole other essay on that. I think sharing ideas is very important, so I read and write a lot. I subscribe to a few tech email newsletters to know what's going. 


I would go into my thoughts on software but that wouldn't be as comprehensive as my __philosophy__. I think a good developer is more than just a coding machine, but a __thinker__. There's a lot of room for creativity software development is an art. I think the values I have guide me to not just be a good __coding machine__, but a good __software developer__. I have a lot to learn regarding the art but it's been really interesting seeing how important philosophies are when programming. This was one thing I mentioned in my post in that group project software course. The course didn't touch upon other ways but I got exposed to them first there. If you asked me about one software opinion I have, it's that strongly typed static languages are better than weakly typed static languages because of less bugs and errors popping up during compilation instead of runtime. A study actually confirmed this with a number like 10% less bugs. So typescript > javascript. Also flutter looks amazing for making android/ios apps and I want to make this one meal planning app idea I have. The langauge behind it, Dart, is statically typed and flutter gets better performance than react native. I'll end on this interesting quote I have saved which I think transfers to software teams as well:

What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, 
led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey.
When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to 
winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. 
I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that 
you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room

So now you know a lot about me. Like, a lot. This was a massive dump of my personality, interests, and my tools, so I hope you enjoyed and maybe check out my stuff and adopt them as well. Adios.
