Learn about my thinking style and sweet computer setup.

## Why I wrote this

Firstly, why am I writing this? Mainly to share my thinking style and computer hardware/software setup so others can learn more about me if they're interested. This is for friends and anyone on Linkedin who wants to know more about me. Also saves me time, I can write this once and share this unlimited times instead of having to repeat it every time for a interview.

And You can't know someone from just their github and linkedin, there's so little details about them, unless they write a about me article like I did here. There is much to know about their personality beyond them because most people don't write about themselves.

I've realized in the internship interview process, in behavioral round or recruiter chat, I get asked a very open ended question, "tell me about yourself". When they ask me, you can't expect a in depth answer unless I have a script to read from. If someone asks you that, where would you start? How would you make your resposne interesting? For me, it's a big question, not because I don't have anything to say about myself, but gathering all my thoughts on the spot is hard. This script took me 6-8 hours to write over 4 sessions and I changed it a lot in every iteration. It's been polished to give the best answer possible. And then the interviewer might as well read that script instead of hearing me say it live because it saves us both time. Reading is on average faster than speaking (google says 230 wpm vs. 150). Also less awkward because the student, like me, would go on a 15 minute monologue. So here's my script which you can read instead at your convenience. You can read this at 0 time cost to me. Answer once, share anywhere.

Personal experience actually, I got asked the "tell me about yourself" question in a initial 30 minute chat with the founder of a startup. I thought too little and gave a garbled answer. So this experience coupled with me being the kind of person who likes to sharm my thoughts + philosophy + pc setup + productivity tools + got me to write this article. 

Do I think the answer to the question "tell me about yourself" is important and says a lot about someone? Absolutely. Describing your interests and who you are says a boatload about you. Say a student is usually 18-22 years old. They've been exposed to many perspectives (hopefully), especially in the age of the internet where physical distance is negligble. Information flows freely. What worldviews have one solidified by then? What are their interests, beliefs? If one doesn't have some views, they haven't explored and thought about the world. They haven't spend enough time thinking about the world, it's problems, how it works, etc. Probably just in idle entertainment, which is plentiful and boundles. I've seen people like this, who don't read the news, don't know what's going on. It's like they live life on mindless autopilot, purely a product of their environment. So this question does give you a good view inside their brains, if they are given time to gather their thoughts.

Also shows if they are a interesting person, here is one [Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-a-person-interesting?top_ans=131321646) I like.

There's a quote I read about software, the difference between a junior and senior dev is that a senior dev has made up opinions on how to do certain things. And experience is not just enough. Thinking ability and perception is just as important to make use of experience. As a quote goes, one can have 10 years of experience, or the same year, 10 times. The latter part means repeating without learning.
 
I believe people who read about all sorts of topics are interesting because they able to see things from a variety of perspectives and you can have a discussion with them. Not just programming but even psychology, self improvement, history. It's interesting when I meet someone like this and it's evident early on when I introduce a probing topic that I think they would be familiar with, and they give interesting responses and perspectives. Especially a fellow CS student where we can talk about a programming topic or tool.

There's a email called console (on substack) I'm subscribed to of a guy who asks these kind of questions in interviews to creators of open source projects. One question he asks is for their most controversial opinion and why, I love reading the answer to that. Shows critical thought, one for example was "everyone should make their own tools", which would be very time intensive. The author is one of those people I'd be interested in talking to. He has that kind of thinking in regards to asking questions if it was applied to vast world of software. With impactful software, especially open source ones like the productivity tools I talk about later on which I use to get around my computer faster, need out of the box thinking. It's all about the idea. You gotta be a thinker to be a good developer, see things from different perspectives. It's not knowing just __how__ to code/create but also knowing __what__ to code/create. Steve jobs is a good example, he couldn't program, which was surprising to me when I read it, but his ability to see the big picture and his minimalist philosophy could directly be applied to Apple's hardware and software practices. That had a big influence on why Apple was and is a leader in innovation, like with the recent M1 chip and it's crazy efficiency. And this applies to any field where you make/handle complex things. The ability to see from different perspectives is a key skill. I used to watch a lot of debates, and did my fair share on the internet (haha), so I've managed to hone this skill. Debating is underrated and helps you learn to think from different angles.

## Most students aren't writers

One thing I've realized is most students aren't writers, they're not keen to share their thoughts. I saw this on a discussion board one of my software classes had, on this nice platform called discourse.org. At the very end, I asked about what lessons people learnt over the 3 month long group project making a goods trading software like Kijiji but with only text. 192 were taking the course, every group had 6-8 members, there were 24-32 groups. These were big groups, the software specs given were complicated to a degree, like having a viewable inventory, user/admin account, trading requests, etc. Also a few custom features we wanted. The implementation of the specs were open ended so I learnt a lot like how to brainstorm, plan, and split work in a software team. This was the most lenghty group project I had ever engaged in. Using a plugin, I saw my group's codebase was 10,000 lines of code long, excluding empty lines and comments. Big project.

So after it was all done and submitted I made a post on the discussion board and wrote all my lessons over 7 paragraphs. Remember there was 192 people taking the class. The post had 138 views. But only one person replied to my post with his lessons learnt, in some paragraphs. He had some of same lessons I had like plan meetings properly and be prepared, and some other interesting ones as well like how everyone really works differently. 138 people took the same course, each probably spent 50-150 hours on the project, but only one person had anything at all to say? I was suprised. 

There's a phenomenom according to [this study](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/10-of-twitter-users-generate-over-90-of-content-study-finds-1.791107), "More than 90 per cent of the content on Twitter is generated by just 10 per cent of the people". Everyone should have replied to my post, at least tens of replies, it was relateable to every single student. Most students aren't writers.

## Active students

I've seen there's a core group of active students. Active students who engage in class, think, answer questions, take initiative. I try to be that active. I like interacting and sharing my thoughts/ideas. It was easier to see who was like this when classes went online with Zoom, talking in the chat was easy. I've seen some students who are active in one class also active in the discussion board or the programming club. Same ones I see online I bump into in person. Same ones I see in person I bump into online. Interesting pattern. Not all of the active students, just some, but enough to notice it.

## About me and my interests

I enjoy alone time and learning and reading. I would say I'm a Type A personality. I like talking 1 on 1 with classmates I found notable in some way like their participation in class, and asking questions about their experiences of school, internship, etc. Asking questions get me a lot of interesting info I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. I also like reading online about others experiences, for example there is a blog I read called "Letters to me when I was a junior developer", which I am. I believe sharing knowledge is invaluable and what makes the internet so interesting.

I always found meaning in learning. So I read articles of all sort, history, business, society, you name it. If I were to retire tomorrow, I would spend most of my time reading the books on my to read list. I've always been a curious person and if you ask those I interact with, you'll get that I ask a lot of questions. Questions makes life interesting. It's the master key to learning about others and anything. A good question in like a well directed arrow, it gets to the flesh of the matter. It gets you the infomration you want. It's a powerful skill that makes life colorful and I wonder why more people aren't as curious.

I have a lot of interests which are reflected in my youtube subs. They are all educational content, from geopolitics (Caspian Report) to urban planning (City Beautiful) to programming (Fireship). Fireship is a great channel, the guy does x tool or x language in 100 seconds for a brief overview. For news I mainly read a daily email newsletter from Axios, giving me just the 10 most important news items of the past day. Distills all that noise that is in the bloated 24 hour news cycle. I enjoy biking, reading nonfiction; of many topics, society, history, autobiographies, and I enjoy writing (when the chance arises). 

I subscribe to a few email newsletters on a variety of things, one on better thinking (Clear Thinking), another on climate change (Global Footprint), another about someone's thought on personal finance and the economy (awealthofcommonsense.com). My inbox has a bunch of past unread ones from when times get busy haha, but they all go to my less important email. I love TED talks. 

I write a daily reflection every night using a daily planner notion template I found online and modified. I also do a weekly and monthly reflection. My first yearly will be at the end of 2022 since I started doing all this in Dec 2021. I'm big on self improvement and becoming a better person than I was yesterday, last week, last month, last year. One of my favorite quotes, “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.” -Ernest Hemingway

I'm __frugal__ and a __minimalist__. I only buy things I will use a lot. I barely have a drawer of clothes because I only need so much clothes. I think about what's needed and cut out the bloat, maximizing efficiency. It's a valuable belief, especially in this age of consumerism, where people buy more than they need or reasonable use. I read from this one developer's blog, maintain high quality, even at the cost of features. Less is more.

The minimalism part permeates everything. From who I choose to socialize with, how I want to approach software, how I deal with information, which is to distill it as much as I can. It's kind of funny how it contrasts with me having so many interests and someone obsessed with the details.

I'm an independent minded person, I don't follow the status quo blindly, I like debate so I'm able to compare things critically. I try to see things for what they really are, not just what they look on the superficial level. I do a lot of research when deciding on something like what tools to use (like react vs. vue).

Analysis paralysis is also a problem, it's a skill to know just how much info you need to make an informed belief. I try to have beliefs with rigorous logical standards. I try to be a rational. I would say I'm pretty calm. During exams my mental state is calm and my thinking isn't impaired. A prof told me how students would tell him they get nervous and can't think right during a hard exam. Even in my hardest exam in my life, for a 2nd year statistics class, I didn't panic. I stoicly accepted my fate as I struggled. This calmness also helps me procrastinate lol. But my daily planner notion template helps with procrastination, even if a bit. I still have that issue.

I'm a big fan of notion, I use it for my daily planner + to do list, for my class notes + class links (easy to access all in one place), my internship resources and application tracker, basically everything to organize my life. But for notes, I use Obisidian to gather all the info I document and the article I plan on reading later. But it keeps getting longer, too much to read, not enough time. 

One reason I like writing (with a keyboard), is because I like recording what happens in life and recording interestng advice/websites/quotes I come across. I am a history fan so the writing part is preserving my history in a sense. There is also this Chinese proverb, “the faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory.” Many things you won't just remember like what you did today 6 months in the future. Take the burden of remembering off your brain and onto your notebook. And you can reflect on how you were on the past.

## My awesome pc setup

I tinker a lot with my computer setup, both physical and software. 

I maximize keyboard shortcuts being used in place of my mouse. With this one chrome extension, vimium, I can click any button on the screen with just my keyboard, I can go down half a page and up with my right index and middle finger. I use this all the time to go up and down. And I can go back or forward in history with just pressing 3 and 4 instead of clicking the small back/forward arrow. This other extension lets me navigate and select google search results and pages with just the arrow keys. So if I type "github" into google, an arrow points at the first result, and I can press enter to click on the first search result, or click the down arrow to move the arrow to the next bottom search result. It's surprising google did not implement this already, it's makes so much faster. 

I use windows 10 but after graduation will switch to mac OS due to the cleaner design and functionality. For example, spotlight search functionality from mac OS should be standard on windows. Instead windows has the start menu which has way too many items on it and the search bar is small, it's in the bottom left of the screen instead of the center. The windows 10 one is also a downgrade from windows 7, because it searches the internet sometimes, when there's chrome for that. Redundant feature which sometimes is annoying when you're searching for a file but it searches google. Also look at the way the time is displayed in the taskbar. It says AM/PM, which is redundant, of course someone knows if its AM or PM. Basic time sense. And it shows the year, 2021. Of course someone knows what year it is, come on. Knowing how to cut down something to it's essentials is a big part of my thinking. 

I replaced the start menu with a program called powertoys run, a open source project, which is much quicker and more accurate.

Here is my desktop. Notice the clock looks different + the taskbar slim and centered. This is the peak windows aesthetic:

![nov 2021 desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/141608565-927882d3-a9b7-499f-ae32-a96ba489fa19.JPG)

I have a 27" 4k monitor on a table mount, and the center of the monitor is at eye level so it makes me sit with my back and neck up straight. Online you'll read advice everywhere saying the top of monitor should be at eye level but that makes you bend your head down to see most of the screen so that doesn't make no sense. My table is mostly empty. I try to have as few things in my room as possible so it's as clean as my desktop wallpaper. 

## My most used tool - my keyboard

In July 2021 I built a custom split keyboard from 4 parts (pcb, case plates, switches, keycaps, plus cables and tenting screws) to maximize comfort and make the layout predictable so it's easier to type without looking. My keyboard is optimized for programming and writing both physically shape wise and digitally keymap wise. I made a custom keymap and experimented to optimize it. I changed the keymap 15-20 times before I settled on the current one. I can program and do everything without my hands having to get displaced. On a normal keyboard, when using the arrow keys when programming, your hand is constantly displaced. With mines, all arrow keys are right under my left thumb. I also switched to a keyboard layout called Colemak DH. According to calculations, total finger movement is half of QWERTY because the most used keys are put on the home row. 

For most of the day my 2 hands rest on this magnificient tool:

![white keyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/167340141-da6299a2-272a-46af-81b9-3167e9b27f09.jpg)

The trackball mouse lets my comfortably move my mouse with only my thumb. No hand movement needed.

Notice the columns are parallel and the horizontal curve matches the natural curve of the fingers. You'll read stories of programmers getting nerve pain/damage so I took proactively did this to make typing ergonomic. Prevention > cure. I also switched to Colemak DH. I topped out at 120 WPM for QWERTY when I took a typing test, but it's realistically not my real world typing speed, your brain doesn't think that fast. At first switching from QWERTY was painful as every since I was a wee child I was using it so 15 years of muscle memory had to be rewired, but I was able to without that much difficulty, I wonder how it varies by person. When I started a few days on the first day I did a typing test and started at 10 wpm. But I kept on going and a few weeks later was at 60 wpm, a good speed. Am now at 75 wpm. Realistically I think I am the same speed as qwerty. The split part of the keybaord is the best part. Try it yourself, spread out your arms straight out forward and ghost type. Then bring them closer like a normal keyboard. This should be enough to convice anyone of how much more comfortable a split keyboard is. It's a pleasure to type because of the parallel columns and maximized homerow usage. I can't put it in words, you gotta feel it to appreciate it.

![iris layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/134281550-5646a149-4423-410c-ae1a-52b61e58b5e0.png)

Here is my keyboard layout, composed of 2 layers. Highly optimized for coding. Notice how on the bottom layer, the numbers are arranged on the right half and the symbols on the left. The MOD1 key to the right of my right pinky switches to the second layer when held, like shift. This took a good bit of thought and improvement, I changed my layout like 15-20 times and this is the longest one I've held on to so far, 2+ months.

The layout was made with this drag and drop webapp: https://config.qmk.fm/#/keebio/iris/rev5/LAYOUT

Interesting graph of my speed increase when I switched to Colemak, from July to March:

![colemak speed increase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/167340696-ecac8740-278b-4cd8-9568-c887a97a7efa.JPG)

I remapped default shortcuts to reduce finger movement. The most common one I use is switching between tabs. I use my left index finger at rest to do this. You know how moving between tabs is control + tab and control + shift + tab? I used powertoys keyboard manager to intercept me typing alt + t and alt + g to those change tab shortcuts. My t key is on my left index finger rest position and g is to the right of that. It's the closest key position for the most common action as it should be.

I measured my real world key usage over a few days so I could compare QWERTY and Colemak DH. This is about 15% programming. Notice how arbitrary QWERTY is.

![qwerty vs  colemak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/138557395-f203aa18-7f32-4e52-ada2-ea0404ce196d.png)

It's odd to me that programmers use their keyboard for their jobs, for their whole lives, and non programmers as well, but those who I know, students and full time alike, haven't changed a thing about their keyboards. Even remapping the caps lock key to the backspace button reduces right pinky movement significantly. Their most used tool is unoptimized.

## How to buy my keyboard - skip if not interested

If you want this keyboard here is a guide. Skip this paragraph if you don't. 

The name is iris rev6, rev as in revision, open this link: https://keeb.io/collections/pre-built-keyboards/products/iris-keyboard-pre-built. You choose the parts and it gets pre built for you. But some parts are missing, so separately you get the keycaps, tenting screws to raise the front up, index key bump dots, and maybe a good looking usb-c to usb-a wire to connect the keyboard to your pc. Costs $300-$400 cad total but worth it as your keyboard is your most used tool: 
- For switches I recommend the milky gatereon yellows, they are nice light linears, great for typing, 7305 hot swap sockets, white acrylic case, middle layer is frosted with tenting holes, or clear if not, for the left and right thumub area, 2 1u keys for both, and a 1.5m white usb c cable. If you want even better switches with 1.2mm distance instead of 2mm (gatereons) which is noticeable, and 40g vs. 50g, and can deal with a light work popping in the switches, I recommend excluding the switches in the order and buying the kailh speed silver switches separately from flashquark.com. Plus a switch puller so you can remove them if needed from the hotswap sockets. 
- The best value keycaps I found that look nice: https://kbdfans.com/collections/dsa-profile/products/dsa-ergo?variant=21329987141690. Couldn't find as anything as good looking for this cheap, truly a great value. Others are 50 dollars minimum. From the same site grab a nice looking usb c to usb a like this one: https://kbdfans.com/products/type-c-usb-cable-1-2m?_pos=4&_sid=5e52c3c10&_ss=r. Maybe even replace the usb c to usb c from keeb.io with a nice braided one from kbdfans. You do see the wire a lot in between the halves when sitting down so maybe it will improve "the view". 
- Keyboard locator dots: https://cnibsmartlife.ca/products/locator-dots-6-pack. 
- I recommend tenting the front side of the keyboard up, it requires 8 wing nuts + 8 hex nuts + 8 1/4" thick screws (4 1.5" long + 4 2.5" long). Can get online or at home depot. Follow this vid: youtube.com/watch?v=kxwHtumvQmc&ab_channel=Keebio.

## Some more of my philosophy

I'm a big fan of __innovation__ and __optimization__. Powertoys run and my keyboard and pc setup are some examples. And how does this relate to software? One of software's purposes is to optimize tasks. Make them easier, more powerful. Many open source programs were made to make things easy and fast, like powertoys run replacing the start menu as a faster, better looking, featureful alternative.

I would go more into my thoughts on software but that wouldn't be as comprehensive as my __philosophy__. I think a good developer is more than just a coding machine, but a __thinker__. There's a lot of room for creativity as software development is an art with different philosophies. I have a lot to learn regarding the art but it's been interesting seeing the different philosophies. The Linux philosophy made it as great as it is with the mantra "do one thing and do it well."

## Software opinions

If you asked me about one software opinion I have, it's that strongly typed static languages are better than weakly typed dynamic languages because of less bugs as then they are caught during static analysis, as well as the better readability. A [study](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/) actually confirmed about 15% less bugs with Typescript vs. Javascript. 

## Conclusion

I'll end on this interesting quote I have saved, reminds me of some open source projects and how far they've gone despite starting small, and not having much resources, like Linux, Git, and SQLite:

https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room -

What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, 
led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey.
When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to 
winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. 
I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that 
you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.”

So now you know a crap ton about me. I tried to share the most interesting and relevant things I can think of about myself a person and relevant to software. This was a massive dump of my personality, interests, and tools, so I hope you enjoyed them and even adopt my tools. If you use a computer for a living, not just program, that keyboard and whole pc setup will definitely make life better. Thanks for reading.
