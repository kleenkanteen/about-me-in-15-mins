Learn about my thinking style and sweet computer setup.



Firstly, why am I writing this? Well, to mainly share my thinking style. I've looked at the githubs and linkedins of others, but they don't tell much about themselves. Projects on github do show passion and interest, but there's a lot more to someone than their work. So people reading this can know about me what they would need an extended period of time talking with me otherwise. One thing I've also realized is most students my age aren't writers, they're not keen to share their thoughts. I saw this on class discussion board. I like writing so here it goes.

I tinker a lot with my computer setup, physical and software. I use windows 10 but after graduation will switch to mac OS due the cleaner OS, for example, spotlight search 
should standard on windows. Instead it has the start menu which looks bad and the search bar is small, in the bottom left of the screen. The windows 10 one is also a downgrade from windows 7, because it searches the internet sometimes. Who searches the internet from the search bar? Also look at the way time is displayed. It says AM/PM, which is redundant, of course someone knows if its AM or PM. And it shows the year, 2021. Of course someone knows what year it is. Knowing how to cut down something to it's essentials is a big part of my thinking. I'm frugal and a minimalist. I think about what's needed and not cut out the bloat, maximizing efficiency. It's a valuable skill, especially in this age of consumerism, as well as in software. Although with software there's that ease of use tradeoff. For the start menu and time display, I've replaced both. I use a program called powertous run that finds and launches programs files quicker. Here is a picture of both thes things. Excuse the small launcher box, it's a bug that happened with the most recent windows update:

And here is my windows desktop:

And here is my keyboard, my most used tool:

Notice how also I don't use QWERTY. 2 months ago in July 2021 I built that keyboard to maximize comfort, for less hand movement. I can program and do everything without moving my hands away. For programming, your right hand moves a lot with the arrows keys. With this, all arrow keys are on my left hand. I switched to a keyboard layout called Colemak DH. According to calculations, finger movement is half of that of QWERTY. It maximizes home row key usage and lateral movement for the fingers for the most used keys other than the home row ones. And that is perfect since my keyboard has parallel columes. The horizontal curve matches the natural curve of the 5 fingers. I topped out at 120 WPM for QWERTY when I took a typing test.
