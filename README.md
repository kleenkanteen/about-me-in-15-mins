Learn about my thinking style and sweet computer setup.

Firstly, why am I writing this? Well, to mainly share my thinking style. I've looked at the githubs and linkedins of others, but they don't tell much about themselves. Projects on github do show passion and interest, but there's a lot more to someone than their work. So people reading this can know about me what they would need an extended period of time talking with me otherwise. One thing I've also realized is most students my age aren't writers, they're not keen to share their thoughts. I saw this on class discussion board. I like writing so here it goes.

I tinker a lot with my computer setup, physical and software. I use windows 10 but after graduation will switch to mac OS due the cleaner OS, for example, spotlight search 
should standard on windows. Instead it has the start menu which looks bad and the search bar is small, in the bottom left of the screen. The windows 10 one is also a downgrade from windows 7, because it searches the internet sometimes. Who searches the internet from the search bar? Also look at the way time is displayed. It says AM/PM, which is redundant, of course someone knows if its AM or PM. And it shows the year, 2021. Of course someone knows what year it is. Knowing how to cut down something to it's essentials is a big part of my thinking. I'm __frugal__ and a __minimalist__. I think about what's needed and not cut out the bloat, maximizing efficiency. It's a valuable skill, especially in this age of consumerism, as well as in software. I also find meaning in learning. If I were to retire tomorrow, I would spend a good chunk of my free time reading every book on my list. I've always been curious and if you ask others around me abut it, you'll get that I ask a lot of questions. I have a lof ot interests as well like history, reading the news (from efficient sources), biking, reading about tech, as well as writing (of course). My notes folder is too big and I am a fan of notion.

For the start menu and time display, I've improved both. I use a program called powertous run that finds and launches programs files quicker. Here is a picture of both thes things. Excuse the small launcher box, it's a bug that happened with the most recent windows update:

And here is my windows desktop:

And here is my keyboard, my most used tool:

And here is my keyboard layout, composed of 2 layers, the MOD1 key to the right of my right pinky switches to the second one on hold:

Notice how also I don't use QWERTY. Also noticn how the symbols and are are optimized for programming. Navigating with just my left thumb is a god send.

2 months ago in July 2021 I built that keyboard to maximize comfort, for less hand movement. I can program and do everything without moving my hands away. For programming, your right hand moves a lot with the arrows keys. With this, all arrow keys are on my left hand. I switched to a keyboard layout called Colemak DH. According to calculations, finger movement is half of that of QWERTY. It maximizes home row key usage and lateral movement for the fingers for the most used keys other than the home row ones. And that is perfect since my keyboard has parallel columes. The horizontal curve matches the natural curve of the 5 fingers. I topped out at 120 WPM for QWERTY when I took a typing test. Not realistic on my real world one, but at first switching was painful. On monkeytype.com I did a typing test and started at 10 wpm. But I kept on ging and after a month I'm at 60 wpm to speed. Realistically I think I am the same as qwerty when typing. I feel a lot of the keys are logicaly placed better now, like on the home row, and it is nice being able to tupe with your hands spread apart.

It's odd to me that many, if not most, programmers use their keyboard for their jobs, for their lives, but haven't changed a thing about their keyboards. Even remappint the caps lock key to the backspace button reduces pinky movement by a lot.  

I also have a 27" 4k display on a table mount, and the center is at eye level I'm somewhat forced to sit with my back straight. My desk is mostly empty. I try to have as few things in my room as possible so it's as clean as my desktop. 

What do these things tell about me? I would say __innovation__. I'm an independent minded person, I don't follow the status quo blindly, I do a good bit of debate so I'm able to compare things critically. And I'm a big believer in __improvement__, I try to see things for what they could be, not just what they are. I think idea sharing goes a long way in this as well. So I subscribe to a few tech email newsletters just to know what's the latest things in tech. 

And how does this relate to software? One of software's purposes is to make things easier. Many open source programs were made to improve upon something, like the powertoys run program above. 

I would go into my thoughts on software but that wouldn't be as comprehensive as my __philosophy__. I think a good developer is more than just a coding machine, but a __thinker__. There's a lot of room for creativity software development is an art. I think the values I have guide me to not just be a good __coding machine__, but a good __software developer__. The concepts of DRY, SOLID, YAGNI naturally appeal to me because they're meant to maximize efficiency. I have a lot to learn regarding the art but it's been really interesting reading and making things. I'll end on this interesting quote I have saved:

>What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, 
>led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey.
>When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to 
>winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. 
>I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that 
>you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room
