# about-me-in-15-mins
Learn about my thinking style and sweet computer setup.

Firstly, why am I writing this? Well, to mainly share my thinking style and computer hardware/software setup so others can learn more about me if they're interested. This is for friends and anyone on Linkedin who wants to know more about me. Also saves me time, I can write this once and share this unlimited times instead of having to repeat it every time I talk to someone who asks me about this.

I've realized in the behavioral round for a internship, or by a recruiter, I get asked a very open ended question, "tell me about yourself". When they ask me, you can't expect a in depth answer unless I have a script to read from. If someone asks you that, where would you start? How would you make your resposne interesting? For me, it's a big question, not because I don't have anything to say about myself, but gathering all my thoughts on the spot is hard. This script took me 6-8 hours to write over 4 sessions and I changed it a lot in every iteration. It's been polished and well thought over. So a few hours of effort has been distilled to give the best answer possible. And then interviewer might as well read that script instead of hearing me say it because it saves us both time. Reading is on average faster than speaking (google says 230 wpm vs. 150). Also less awkward because the student, like me, would go on a 15 minute monologue. So here's my script which you can read instead at your convenience. So instead of me repeating the same script over and over, you can read this at 0 time cost to me. Answer once, share anywhere.

Personal experience actually, I got asked the "tell me about yourself" question in a (initial) "chat" over zoom with the founder of a small tech company. And I got caught flat footed, didn't know where to start, first time someone asked me it in many years. Was the first time I got an interview (of some sort) with a company I applied to. I gave some info in 2ish minutes but honestly it was a poor answer, all over the place, much worse than this. I got rejected a few days later and I realized the chat was basically knowing who I was and my interests relating to software I guess. I didn't really know what he meant by that initial open ended question. What do I say about myself? He did ask later on what I made, maybe he expected me to talk about a side project as well. Whatever the case, I answered that question horribly. So this experience coupled with me being the kind of person who likes to sharme my thoughts, like about my philosophy, pc setup, and productivity tools, got me to write this article. 

Do I think the answer to the question "tell me about yourself" is important, meaning it says a lot about someone? Yes. Describing your interests and who you are says a boatload about you. Say a student is usually 18-22 years old. If they learn to speak at the 1 year mark, and that's when they start to understand what others say, that means they've been speaking/listening for 6205 to 7665 days. Lotta days. They've been exposed to many perspectives (hopefully), especially in the age of the internet where physical distance is neglible, what worldviews have one solidified by then? What are their interests, beliefs? If one doesn't have some views, they haven't explored and thought about the world. Not enough time  thinking about the world, it's problems, how it works, etc. Probably just idle entertainment. I've seen people like this, who don't read the news, don't know what's going on. It's like they live life on mindless autopilot. So this question does give you a good view inside their brains, or more accurately, what is has accumulated there in 18-22 years. 

So in conclusion, this "tell me about yourself" question, when answered in a prepared and lenghty manner as I'm doing right now, shows how one's mind and views have formed after living in a complex and interesting world. And it a time where knowledge is so free and accessible. So how is one not interesing in such a complex, interesting world and not form any viewpoints? Open ended question as what does interesting mean? If you are interested this [Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-a-person-interesting?top_ans=131321646) is great.

There's a quote I read about software, the difference between a junior and senior dev is that a senior dev has made up opinions on how to do certain things. But experience is not enough, thinking ability, perception, is just as important.
 
I believe people who read about all sorts of topics are interesting because they able to see things from a variety of perspectives, critically, and you can have a discussion with them. It's interesting when I meet someone like this and it's evident early on when I introduce a probing topic that I think they would be familiar with, they ask interesting questions and say interesting comments. Like for a linux + systems programming course, I went to office hours once over zoom, which are neglected by students even thought they're a great place to get to know and chat with your professor or teaching assistant (a 3rd/4th year student hired to help the prof teach and grade). In this case there was the professor and 2 teaching assistants in the zoom meeting, quietly waiting for any students. I have a feeling that in most office hours, which has been true so far to what I've seen, the prof/TA get no students attending, unless it's right before an assignment or test, and if students do come, then they mainly talk about the course content. Only a small fraction of the times I have been to office hours I saw students talking about something other the course content such as a random interesting topic. So in that instance, I went to office hours and brought up some topics and expressed my opinions about them. One of them was that the title software engineer is pretentious and inaccurate, since there are no standards like with mechanical/civil engineers to get tested and licensed, so the proper term is software developer as it doesn't have the "engineer" connotation. We had a interesting talk about that and  other topics.

So interesting people are interesting to talk to. And this transfers directly to the software world. There's a email 
called console (on substack) I'm subscribed to of a guy who asks these kind of questions in interviews to creators of open source projects. The answers are insightful, like he asks for their most controversial opinion and why. The author is one of those people I'd be interested in talking to. He has that kind of thinking in regards to asking questions if it was applied to vast world of software. With software, the impactful ones you see, especially open source ones like say the productivity tools I talk about later on which I use to get around my computer faster, need out of the box thinking. It's all about the idea. You gotta be a thinker to be a good developer, see things from different perspectives. It's not knowing just __how__ to code/create but also knowing __what__ to code/create. Steve jobs is a good examble, he couldn't code, was surprising to me when I read it, but his ability to see the big picture and his minimalist philosophy could directly be applied to Apple's hardware and software practices and that's why Apple was and is a leader in innovation, like with the recent M1 chip. And this applies to any field where you make/handle complex things. The ability to see from different perspectives is a skill. I used to watch a lot of debates, and did my fair share on the internet hah, so I've managed to hone this skill well. Debating is underrated and helps you learn to think wide and critically.

One thing I've realized is most students aren't writers, they're not keen to share their thoughts. I saw this on a discussion board one of my software classes had, on this nice platform called discourse.org. At the very end, I asked about what lessons people learnt over the 3 month long group project making a goods trading software like kijiji. Every group had 6-8 members, these were big groups, the software specs given were also complicated to a degree, like having a global inventory, searching, user/admin account, etc. We also were to add some custom features that we wanted. The implementation of the specs were open ended so I learnt a lot like how to brainstorm, plan, and split work in a software team. This was the most lenghty group project I had ever engaged in in my life. Using a plugin, my group's codebase was 20,000 lines of code long, excluding empty lines and comments. I plan on deploying it to the web actually some time. So made that post and wrote all my lessons over 7 paragraphs. There was 200 people taking that class. The post had 138 views. But only one person replied to my post asking about lessons learnt. And he replied well. He had some of same lessons I had, like plan meetings properly and be prepared, and some other interesting ones as well. 138 people took the same course, each probably spent 50-150 hours on the project, and only one person had anything at all to say? I was bummed. But it's a phenomenom, according to [this study](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/10-of-twitter-users-generate-over-90-of-content-study-finds-1.791107), "More than 90 per cent of the content on Twitter is generated by just 10 per cent of the people". Albeit some diffences to Twitter, but everyone should have replied, at least tens of replies, it was relateable to every single student. As I said about not knowing how somone is like from just their github and linkedin, there's so little details about them. There is much to know about their personality beyond this because most people don't write about themselves.

Moving on, I always found meaning in learning. So I I read articles of all sort, history, business, society, you name it. If I were to retire tomorrow, I would spend a good chunk of my free time reading the books on my to read list. I've always been a curious person and if you ask those I interact with, you'll get that I ask a lot of questions. Questions makes life interesting. It's the master key to learning about others, you can unlock treaure boxes with good questions. I attended a virtual career fair held by my uni recently and just by asking some good questions I was able to learn a good deal and it was entertaining. For example, for this cybersecurity position, at the expo booth, there was a person there. He was actually a intern for the same position 4 years back and is full time now. I asked, "What makes one a strong candidate for this position and what do you think you did that helped you be one?". I got a very good answer that I can implement. All due to a well pointed question. It's powerful skill that makes life interesting and I wonder why more people aren't curious.

I have a lot of interests which are reflected in my youtube subs. They are all educational content one way or another, from geopolitics (Caspian Report) to urban planning (City Beautiful) to programming (Firship). Fireship is an amazing channel, the guy does x tool or x language in 100 seconds. For news I mainly read a daily email newsletter from Axios, giving me just the 10 most important news items of the past day. Distills all that noise that is in the bloated 24 hour news cycle. I enjoy biking, reading (nonfiction), of many topics, society, history, autobiographies, and writing (of course). I'm trying to journal daily and reflect what happened daily, weekly, and monthly, but it's tough to be consistent with this.

I'm an independent minded person, I don't follow the status quo blindly, I like debate so I'm able to compare things critically. I try to see things for what they really are, not just what they look on the superficial level. So I do a lot of research when deciding on something like what tools to use (like react vs. vue). But analysis paralysis is also a problem, it's a skill to know how much info you need to make an informed belief. I think sharing ideas is very important, so I read and write a lot. I subscribe to a few email newsletters on a variety of things, one on effective altruism, another on climate change, another about someone's thought on personal finance and the current state of the economy (awealthofcommonsense.com, great stuff). My inbox has a bunch of old unread ones from when times get busy haha, but I subscribe them to my less important email. I love TED talks. 

I'm a big fan of notion, I use it for my to do list, for my class notes, my internship resources and application tracker, basically everything to organize my life. Though I have a lot of to dos like "read this article" and boy has it has overfilled for the past few months. Too much to read, not enough time. I have a google extension called close tab which helps with this. It's a neat open source project. I maximize keyboard shortcuts being used in place of my mouse. With the one chrome extension I can click any button on the screen with just my keyboard, I press "t" and it pops up a small square next to every button with the letter(s) I need to type to click it, like "a". In a text box it's disabled so no conflict when typing. I can also go down half a page and up with just n and e. I use this everywhere. And I can go back or forward in history with just 3 and 4 instead of clicking the arrow. Tweaked the shortcuts well. This other extension lets me navigate google search results and pages with just the arrow keys. So if I type "github" into google, an arrow points at the first result, and I can press enter to click on the first search result. It's surprising google did not implement this already, it's a simple game changer. 

I tinker a lot with my computer setup, both physical and software. I use windows 10 but after graduation will switch to mac OS due to the cleaner design and functionality. For example, spotlight search functionality from mac OS should be standard on windows. Instead windows has the start menu which has way too many items on it and the search bar is small, it's in the bottom left of the screen instead of the center. The windows 10 one is also a downgrade from windows 7, because it searches the internet sometimes, when there's chrome for that. Redundant feature which sometimes is annoying when you're searching for a file but it searches google. Also look at the way the time is displayed in the taskbar. It says AM/PM, which is redundant, of course someone knows if its AM or PM. Basic time sense. And it shows the year, 2021. Of course someone knows what year it is, come on. Knowing how to cut down something to it's essentials is a big part of my thinking. I'm __frugal__ and a __minimalist__. I think about what's needed and cut out the bloat, maximizing efficiency. It's a valuable belief, especially in this age of consumerism, as well as in software. I read from this one programmer, maintain high quality, even at the cost of features. Never sacrifice quality. And less is more.

I replaced the start menu with a program called powertoys run which is much quicker and more accurate.

And here is my desktop. Notice the clock is bettr, the taskbar slimmer and centered. This is the peak windows aesthetic::

![nov 2021 desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/141608565-927882d3-a9b7-499f-ae32-a96ba489fa19.JPG)

In July 2021 I built a custom split keyboard from 4 parts (pcb, case plates, switches, keycaps, plus cables and tenting screws) to maximize comfort and make the layout predictable so it's easier to type without looking. My keyboard is optimized for programming and writing both physically shape wise and digitally keymap wise. I made a custom keymap and experimented to optimize it. I can program and do everything without my hands having to get displaced. On a normal keyboard, when using the arrow keys when programming, your hand is constantly displaced. With mines, all arrow keys are right under my left thumb. I also switched to a keyboard layout called Colemak DH. According to some calculations, total finger movement is half of QWERTY because the most used keys are put on the home row. 

For most of the day my 2 hands rest on this magnificient tool:

![20211218_071702](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/146656695-d95c74ec-4ba4-479b-98f2-79a73d7bfae9.jpg)

Notice the columns are parallel and the horizontal curve matches the natural curve of the fingers. You'll read stories of programmers getting wrist pain so I took this step to make writing, coding, and everything as ergonomic as possible. Prevention > cure. I topped out at 120 WPM for QWERTY when I took a typing test, but it's realistically not my real world typing speed, your brain doesn't think that fast. At first switching from QWERTY was painful as every since I was a wee child I was using it. 15 years of muscle memory had to be rewired, but it's interesting how I was able to without that much difficulty, I wonder how it varies by person. When I started a few days on the first day I did a typing test and started at 10 wpm. But I kept on going and a few weeks later was at 60 wpm, a good speed. Am now at 75 wpm. Realistically I think I am the same speed as qwerty. The split part of the keybaord is the best part. Try it yourself, spread out your arms straight out forward and ghost type. Then bring them closer like a normal keyboard. This should be enough to convice anyone of how much more comfortable a split keyboard is. 

![iris layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/134281550-5646a149-4423-410c-ae1a-52b61e58b5e0.png)

Here is my keyboard layout, composed of 2 layers. The MOD1 key to the right of my right pinky switches to the second layer when held, like shift. This took a good bit of thought and improvement, I changed my layout like 15-20 times and this is the longest one I've held on to so far, 2+ months:

The layout was made with this webapp: https://config.qmk.fm/#/keebio/iris/rev5/LAYOUT

I also utilize or remap shortcuts to reduce finger movement. The most common one I use is switching between tabs. You know how moving between tabs is control + tab and control + shift + tab? I used powertoys keyboard manager to intercept me typing alt + t and alt + g to those shortcuts. Google chrome doesn't let you do it from the settings which sucks but this works with no problems. My t key is on my left index finger rest position and g is to the right of that. Look at where alt + t is in my key layout and you will see how much better it is.

I measured my real world key usage over a few days so I could compare QWERTY and Colemak DH. This is about 15% programming. Notice how arbitrary QWERTY is.

![qwerty vs  colemak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/138557395-f203aa18-7f32-4e52-ada2-ea0404ce196d.png)

It's odd to me that programmers use their keyboard for their jobs, for their whole lives, and non programmers as well, but those who I know, students and full time alike, haven't changed a thing about their keyboards. Even remapping the caps lock key to the backspace button reduces right pinky movement significantly. The most used tool is unoptimized.

If you want this keyboard here are the instructions. Skip this paragraph if not. The name is iris rev 5, rev as in revision: https://keeb.io/collections/pre-built-keyboards/products/iris-keyboard-pre-built. If the iris rev 6 has released by now though, get that instead, it's a bit cheaper, the only difference is the latter has per key rgb and hotswap sockets are pre soldered, so you don't have to solder the sockets on or pay someone like I did, and can pop in the switches from the get go. So get the rev 5 if the rev 6 is not out, and select these options: 
- For switches choose milky gatereon yellows, they are nice light linears, great for typing, 7305 hot swap sockets, white acrylic case, middle layer is frosted with tenting holes, or clear if not, for the left and right thumub area, 2 1u keys for both, and a 1.5m white usb c cable. If you want even better switches with 1.2mm distance instead of 2mm (gatereons) which is noticeable, and 40g vs. 50g, and can deal with a light work popping in the switches, I recommend excluding the switches in the order and buying the kailh speed silver switches separately from flashquark.com. Plus a switch puller so you can remove them if needed from the hotswap sockets. 
- The best value keycaps I found that look nice: https://kbdfans.com/collections/dsa-profile/products/dsa-ergo?variant=21329987141690. Couldn't find as anything as good looking for this cheap, truly a great value. Others are 50 dollars minimum. From the same site grab a nice looking usb c to usb a like this one: https://kbdfans.com/products/type-c-usb-cable-1-2m?_pos=4&_sid=5e52c3c10&_ss=r. Maybe even replace the usb c to usb c from keeb.io with a nice braided one from kbdfans. You do see the wire a lot in between the halves when sitting down so maybe it will improve "the view". 
- Keyboard locator dots: https://cnibsmartlife.ca/products/locator-dots-6-pack. 
- I recommend tenting the front side of the keyboard up also, it requires 8 wing nuts + 8 hex nuts + 8 1/4" thick screws (4 1.5" long screws + 4 2.5" long). Can get online or a hardware store like home depot. Follow this vid: youtube.com/watch?v=kxwHtumvQmc&ab_channel=Keebio. Costs $300-$400 total but worth it as your keyboard is your most used tool.

I have a 27" 4k monitor on a table mount, and the center of monitor is at eye level so it makes me sit with my back and neck up straight. Online you'll read advice everywhere saying the top of monitor should be at eye level but that makes you bend your head down to see most of the screen, makes no sense. My table is mostly empty. I try to have as few things in my room as possible so it's as clean as my desktop wallpaper. 

I'm a big fan of __innovation__ and __optimization__. And how does this relate to software? One of software's purposes is to make things easier. Many open source programs were made to make things easy and fast, like powertoys run replacing the start menu and improving in many ways.

I would go into my thoughts on software but that wouldn't be as comprehensive as my __philosophy__. I think a good developer is more than just a coding machine, but a __thinker__. There's a lot of room for creativity as software development is an art with competing philosophies. I think the values I have guide me to not just be a good __coding machine__, but a good __software developer__. I have a lot to learn regarding the art but it's been interesting seeing how important philosophies are when making something. Like the linux philosophy makes linux what it is.

If you asked me about one software opinion I have, it's that strongly typed static languages are better than weakly typed dynamic languages because of less bugs as then they are caught during static analysis, as well as the better readability. A [study](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/) actually confirmed about 15% less bugs with typescript vs. javascript. Also flutter looks very nice for making android/ios apps and I want to make a ridesharing app idea I had. The langauge behind it, dart, is statically typed and flutter gets better performance than react native because it has it's own rendering engine and compiles to machine code for ios/android while flutter has a javascript bridge in between the app and operating system which is inefficient. It also makes development easier since components are rendered by it's own 2d library, everything looks the same on ios and android. Flutter draws natively provided components which differ between both platforms. So flutter makes development easier. I think it's the future of cross mobile development. It even supports compiling to web using html canvas and webassembly, which is crazy as you are coding in dart, but it somehow works on browsers which run on javascript/html/css. It's only 3 years old also and I think it's a game changer, a lot of companies like Alibaba already use it.

I'll end on this interesting quote I have saved, reminds me of some open source projects and how far they've gone despite starting small, and not having so much resources, like linux, git, or SQLite:

https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room -

What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, 
led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey.
When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to 
winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. 
I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that 
you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.”

So now you know a crap ton about me. I tried to share the most interesting and relevant things I can think of about myself a person and relating to software. This was a massive dump of my personality, interests, and tools, so I hope you enjoyed them and maybe even adopt the tools. And if you plan on programming for a living, that keyboard and key layout will make life much better. Thanks for reading.
