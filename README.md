Learn about my thinking style and sweet computer setup.

Firstly, why am I writing this? Well, to mainly share my thinking style and computer hardware/software setup so others can learn more about me if they're interested. This is for friends and anyone on Linkedin who wants to know more about me. Also saves me time, I can write this once and share this unlimited times instead of having to repeat it every time I talk to someone who asks me about this.

I've realized in the behavioral interview rounds for internship, they may ask a very open question, "tell me about yourself". When they ask a student this, you can't expect a in depth answer unless they have a script ready to read from. This script took me 5-8 hours to write over 3 sessions and I changed it a lot in every iteration. It's been polished and well thought over, it's not easy answering this in a substantial manner. So a few hours of effort has been distilled to give the most descriptive answer possible. And then interviewer might as well read that script then instead of hearing me say it because it saves us both time, they don't have to schedule a behavioral interview for every student, and reading is on average faster than speaking (google says 230 wpm vs. 150). Also less awkward because the student, like me here, would go on a 15 minute monologue. Monologues are nice to read but kinda awkward to listen to in a 2 way conversation like a interview. So here's my script which you can read instead at your convenience. And to add yet another reason, this answer is basically the whole behavioral round, 15 minutes per student. If the round is 60 minutes, 45 out of 60 minutes between the two is saved per round. For the student, imagine they get 10 behaviorial interviews. They'll spend 10 hours of their life, precious also when school is in full swing, for just a chance. So instead of repeating the same script over, they can use the power of writing and the internet to answer this question once and share with 0 time cost. Like the codesignal online assesment, answer once, share anywhere. Super time efficient.

Personal experience actually, I got asked the "tell me about yourself" question in a (initial) "chat" with the founder of a small startup. And I got caught flat footed, didn't know where to start, first time someone asked me that question in many years. I gave some info in 2ish minutes but in all honestly it was a poor answer, all over the place, too garbled, much worse than this. I got rejected a few days later and I realized the chat was basically a behaviorial analysis of me. I didn't really know what he meant by that open ended question. He did ask what I made also, maybe he expected some dazzling personal project or some sort. Though on second thought maybe he expected me to ask him to clarify what he wanted to know about me, I should've asked so I could answer what he wanted to know. Either way I don't know, but this was the first time I got some sort of video chat/interview with someone at the company I applied to. And boy did I blow it. So this experience coupled with me being the kind of person who likes to read/write about my philosophy, pc setup, and productivity tools, got me to write this article. 

Do I think the answer to the question "tell me about yourself" is important, meaning it says a lot about someone? Yes. Describing your interests and who you are says a boatload about you. Say a student is usually 18-22 years old. If they learn to speak at the 1 year mark, and that's when they start to understand what others say, that means they've been speaking/listening for 6205 to 7665 days. Lotta days. They've been exposed to many perspectives (hopefully), especially in the age of the internet where physical distance is neglible, what worldviews have one solidified by then? What are their interests, beliefs? If one doesn't have some views, they haven't explored and thought about the world. Not enough time  thinking about the world, it's problems, how it works, etc. Probably just idle entertainment. I've seen people like this, who don't read the news, don't know what's going on. It's like they live life on mindless autopilot. So this question does give you a good view inside their brains, or more accurately, what is has accumulated there in 6205 to 7665 days. 

Most of the classes I've took in my life since I can remember from middle school were probably useless if I think about what I got. I think the north american education system up till the end of high school is too easy and broken. Just thinking silently for many hours and reading whatever on the internet taught me to think more critically than what all of my english classes have done. There's people who are 50, 60 years old and they're not getting vaccinated. Such a long life and they still haven't understood the societal concept of specialization and trusting expertise. This quote explains that phenomenom well, "Some people have 10 years of experience. Others have 1 year of experience 10 times." You have to think properly if you want to make use of your experiences. Older does not mean wiser. At one point in middle school I just started thinking every night about what happened in the day and that unlocked a new part of my brain. The very basic litmus test of getting vaccinated was a mind boggling statistic of how many people haven't figured out basic concepts like specialization. 

So in conclusion, this "tell me about yourself" question, when answered in a prepared and lenghty manner as I'm doing right now, shows how one's mind and views have formed after living in a complex and interesting world. And it a time where knowledge is so free and accessible. So how is one not interesing in such a complex, interesting world and not form any viewpoints? Open ended question as what does interesting mean? If you are interested this [Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-a-person-interesting?top_ans=131321646) is great.

There's a quote I read about software, the difference between a junior and senior dev is that a senior dev has made up opinions on how to do certain things. But experience is not enough, thinking ability, perception, is just as important.
 
I believe people who read about all sorts of topics are interesting because they able to see things from a variety of perspectives, critically, and you can have a discussion with them. I haven't come across many people like this in a situation where you can chat about anything but when I do it's evident early on, they ask interesting questions and say interesting comments. Like for a linux + systems programming course, I went to office hours once over zoom, which are neglected by students and they're a great place to get to know and chat with your professor/teaching assistant (a upper year student). It this case was the professor and 2 teaching assistants in the zoom meeting, quietly waiting for any students. I have a feeling that in most office hours (which has been true so far to what I've seen), the prof/TA get no students attending, unless it's right before an assignment or test, and if students do come, then they mainly, talk about the course content. Only like 5% of the times I have been to office hours I saw students talking about something other the course content such as a random interesting topic. So as I was saying, in that instance I went to office hours and brought up some topics about the software field and expressed my opinion about them. One of them was that the title software engineer is pretentious and meaningless, since there are no standards like with mechanical/civil engineers to get certified, and the proper term is software developer instead and we had a interesting talk about that and other things.  

So basically, interesting people are interesting to talk to. And this transfers directly to the software world. There's a email newsletter called console (on substack ) I'm subscribed to of a guy who asks these kind of questions (through text interviews) to creators of open source projects. The answers are insightful, like he asks for their most controversial opinion and why. The author is one of those people I'd be interested in talking to. He has that kind of thinking in regards to asking questions if it was applied to vast world of software. With software, the impactful ones you see, especially open source ones like say the productivity tools I talk about later on which I use to get around my computer faster, you need good ideas to make them. It's all about the idea. Once you understand the world, think about it's problems, you are able to change it. You'll read this a lot in start up/incubator sessions if you go to one. You gotta be a thinker to be a good developer, see things from different perspectives. It's not knowing just __how__ to code/create but also knowing __what__ to code/create. Steve jobs is a good examble, he couldn't code, was surprising to me when I read it, but his ability to see the big picture and also his minimalist philosophy could directly be applied to Apple's hardware and software and that's why Apple was and is a leader in innovation, like with the recent M1 chip. And this applies to any field where you make/handle complex things. The ability to see from different perspectives is a skill I've seen many to miss. I used to watch a lot of debates, and did my fair share on the internet haha, so I've managed to hone this skill well, not to brag, but debating helps you learn to think critically.

One thing I've realized is most students aren't writers, they're not keen to share their thoughts. I saw this on a discussion board one of my software classes had, on this nice platform called discourse.org. At the very end, I asked about what lessons people learnt over the 3 month long group project making a goods trading software like kijiji. Every group had 6-8 members, these were big groups, the software specs given were also complicated to a degree, like having a global inventory, searching, user/admin account, etc. We also were to add some custom features that we wanted. The implementation of the specs were open ended so I learnt a lot like how to brainstorm, plan, and split work in a software team. This was the most lenghty group project I had ever engaged in in my life. Using a plugin, my group's codebase was 20,000 lines of code long, excluding empty lines and comments. I plan on deploying it to the web actually some time. So made that post and wrote all my lessons over 7 paragraphs. There was 200 people taking that class. The post had 138 views. But only one person replied to my post asking about lessons learnt. And he replied well. He had some of same lessons I had, like plan meetings properly and be prepared, and some other interesting ones as well. 138 people took the same course, each probably spent 50-150 hours on the project, and only one person had anything at all to say? I was bummed. But it's a phenomenom, according to [this study](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/10-of-twitter-users-generate-over-90-of-content-study-finds-1.791107), "More than 90 per cent of the content on Twitter is generated by just 10 per cent of the people". Albeit some diffences to Twitter, but everyone should have replied, at least tens of replies, it was relateable to every single student. As I said about not knowing how somone is like from just their github and linkedin, there's so little details about them. There is much to know about their personality beyond this because most people don't write about themselves.

Moving on, I always found meaning in learning, history, business, society, you name, I read articles of all sort. If I were to retire tomorrow, I would spend a good chunk of my free time reading the books on my to read list. I've always been a curious person and if you ask those I interact with, you'll get that I ask a lot of questions. Questions makes life interesting. It's the master key to learning about others, you can unlock treaure boxes with good questions. I attended a virtual career fair held by my uni recently and just by asking some good questions I was able to learn a good deal and it was entertaining. For example, for this cybersecurity position, at the expo booth, there was a person there. He was actually a intern for the same position 4 years back and is full time now. I asked, "What makes one a strong candidate for this position and what do you think you did that helped you be one?". I got a very good answer that I can implement. All due to a well pointed question.

I have a lot of interests like watching history from my youtube subs, as well as a variety of educational content from geopolitics (Caspian Report) to urban planning (City Beautiful). My youtube subs probably say a lot about me. For news I mainly read a daily email newsletter from Axios, giving me just the 10 most important news items of the past day. Distills all that noise that is in the bloated 24 hour news cycle. I enjoy biking, reading (nonfiction), of many topics, society, history, autobiographies, and writing (of course). I'm trying to journal daily and reflect what happened daily, weekly, and monthly, but it's tough to be consistent with this.

I'm a big fan of notion, I use it for my to do list, for my class notes, my internship resources and application tracker, basically everything to organize my life. Though I have a lot of to dos like "read this article" and boy has it has overfilled for the past few months. Too much to read, not enough time. I have a google extension called close tab which helps with this. It's a neat open source project. I maximize keyboard shortcuts being used in place of my mouse with vimium and web search navigator. With the first one I can click any button on the screen with just my keyboard, I press "t" and it pops up a small square next to every button with the letter(s) I need to type to click it, like "a". In a text box it's disabled so no conflict when typing. I can also go down half a page and up with just n and e. I use this everywhere. And I can go back or forward in history with just 3 and 4. Tweaked the shortcuts to my liking. The latter extension lets me navigate google search results and pages with just the arrow keys. It's appaling google did not implement this already, using your mouse is cumbersome. 

I tinker a lot with my computer setup, both physical and software. I use windows 10 but after graduation will switch to mac OS due to the cleaner design and functionality. For example, spotlight search functionality from mac OS should be standard on windows. Instead windows has the start menu which has way too many items on it and the search bar is small, it's in the bottom left of the screen instead of the center. The windows 10 one is also a downgrade from windows 7, because it searches the internet sometimes, when there's chrome for that. Redundant feature which sometimes is annoying when you're searching for a file but it searches google. Also look at the way the time is displayed in the taskbar. It says AM/PM, which is redundant, of course someone knows if its AM or PM. Basic time sense. And it shows the year, 2021. Of course someone knows what year it is, come on. Knowing how to cut down something to it's essentials is a big part of my thinking. I'm __frugal__ and a __minimalist__. I think about what's needed and cut out the bloat, maximizing efficiency. It's a valuable belief, especially in this age of consumerism, as well as in software. I read once from this helpful dev, maintain high quality, even at the cost of features. Never sacrifice quality. Less is more.

For the start menu and taskbar time display, I've improved both with how they look. I replaced the start menu with a program called powertoys runand it is much quicker. Here is a picture of both of them. Excuse the small launcher box, it's a bug that happened with the most recent windows update, still usable though:

![about me](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/134280881-986fef91-d7f0-4767-b792-a7911225a101.JPG)

And here is my windows desktop:

In July 2021 I built my custom split keyboard from chosen parts to maximize comfort with less hand movement. I can program and do everything without moving my hands, just my fingers do. For programming, your right hand moves a lot with the arrows keys. With mines, all arrow keys are used with my left thumb. I also switched to a keyboard layout called Colemak DH. According to calculations, total finger movement is half of that of QWERTY because most used keys are on the home row. Notice the columns are parallel and the horizontal curve matches the natural curve of the fingers. You'll read stories of programmers getting wrist pain so I took steps to make writing, coding, everything as comfortable as possible. Prevention > cure. I topped out at 120 WPM for QWERTY when I took a typing test, but it' realistically not my real world typing speed, your brain doesn't think that fast. At first switching layouts was painful as every since I was a wee child I was typing QWERTY. My brain's muscle memory of 15 years typing QWERTY had to be rewired, but it's interesting how I was able to without that much difficulty, I wonder how it varies by person I wonder. When I started a few days on the first day I did a typing test and started at 10 wpm. But I kept on going and now I'm at 60 wpm, a good speed. Realistically I think I am the same as qwerty. Thi split part of the keybaord is the best part. Try it yourself, spread out your arms straight out forward and ghost type. Then bring them closer like a normal keyboard. I think this is enough to convice anyone of how much more comfortable a split keyboard is. For most of the day my 2 hands rest on this thing:

![iris keyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/134283851-9a972128-a0be-46ce-b811-38752611d7e5.jpg)

Here is my keyboard layout, composed of 2 layers. The MOD1 key to the right of my right pinky switches to the second layer when held, like shift. This took a good bit of thought, I changed my layout like 15-20 times and this is latest and longest one, maybe the final form:

![iris layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/134281550-5646a149-4423-410c-ae1a-52b61e58b5e0.png)

I measured my real world key usage over a few days so I could compare QWERTY and Colemak DH head with my own data. This is about 20% programming. Notice how arbitrary QWERTY is.

![qwerty vs  colemak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/138557395-f203aa18-7f32-4e52-ada2-ea0404ce196d.png)

It's odd to me that programmers use their keyboard for their jobs, for their whole lives, but those who I know, students and full time alike, most haven't changed a thing about their keyboards. Even remapping the caps lock key to the backspace button reduces right pinky movement significantly. Their most used tool is unoptimized.

I have a 27" 4k display on a table mount, and the center is at eye level so it kind of makes me sit with my back and neck up straight. Online you'll read advice everywhere saying the top should be at eye level but that makes you to bend your head down as the screen is under, doesn't make sense. My table is mostly empty. I try to have as few things in my room as possible so it's as clean as my desktop wallpaper. 

I'm a big fan of __innovation__ and __optimization__. And how does this relate to software? One of software's purposes is to make things easier. Many open source programs were made to make things easy and fast, like powertoys run replacing the start menu in function.

I'm an independent minded person, I don't follow the status quo blindly, I like debate so I'm able to compare things critically. I try to see things for what they really are, not just what they look on the superficial level. So I do a lot of research when deciding on something like what tools to use (react vs. vue). But analysis paralysis is also a problem, it's a skill to know how much info you need to make an informed belief. I think sharing ideas is very important, so I read and write a lot. I subscribe to a couple email newsletters to satiate my want for perspectives. I enjoy TED talks. 

I would go into my thoughts on software but that wouldn't be as comprehensive as my __philosophy__. I think a good developer is more than just a coding machine, but a __thinker__. There's a lot of room for creativity as software development is an art with competing philosophies. I think the values I have guide me to not just be a good __coding machine__, but a good __software developer__. I have a lot to learn regarding the art but it's been interesting seeing how important differences philosophies are when making something. This was one thing I mentioned in my post in that group project software course, the way you structue your classes (in java), there was MVC compared to what we were taught (a more bloated way taught by Bob Martin). The course didn't touch upon other ways but I got exposed to them there. 

If you asked me about one software opinion I have, it's that strongly typed static languages are better than weakly typed dynamic languages because of less bugs as then they are caught during static analysis, as well as the better readability. A study actually confirmed less bugs, a number like 10% less bugs. So typescript > javascript. Also flutter looks amazing for making android/ios apps and I want to make this one meal planning app idea I have. The langauge behind it, Dart, is statically typed and flutter gets better performance than react native. Very interesting.

I'll end on this interesting quote I have saved which I think transfers to software teams as well:

What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, 
led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey.
When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to 
winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. 
I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that 
you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room

So now you know a crap ton about me. I tried to share the most interesting and relevant things I can think of about myself a person and relating to software. This was a massive dump of my personality, interests, and tools, so I hope you enjoyed them and maybe even adopt the tools. And if you plan on programming for a living, that keyboard and key layout will make life much better. Thanks for reading.
